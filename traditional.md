# Traditional Markdown links

Links:
- [A zettel dir](dir.md)#
- Something within a dir:
  - Works, but unintuitive and breaks links in Github: [filename only](something.md)#
  - Does not work in neuron, but works in Github: [relative path including dir](dir/something.md)#
- [Another zettel](another.md)#

You can see, that the [Forgezettel][1] links are not working here.
